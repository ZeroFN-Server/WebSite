# We no longer use Google Fonts on this Website!
It's "illegal" to use Google Fonts in Germany if you dont add a "Cookie Consent". That is why we are moving to TFNFonts. We have the same fonts as Google Fonts but we host them on our CDN. You can use the fonts too if you have an App or Website*. [Read more](https://tfngames.tk/how-to/use-tfnfonts).



*You have to send us a Link via Discord for your Website to use them! More informations [here](https://google.de)
