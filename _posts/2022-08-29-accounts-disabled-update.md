#Update (19. August 2022)
It is no longer possible to request your account data! If you still need cosmetics, please download the newest update. It contains some outfits like "Khary", "Rhea" and **all** other Platform only outfits.

## Update for disabled Accounts and login page
Maybe you saw that you got logged out of your account. That's because we removed Account features for DevNite (your account is still on our server and data can be requested via email (request@tfngames.tk)). And because of Beta of DevNite we don't activate them before release our game

## What we do now
We freeze all accounts until release of DevNite (to get cosmetic from your Account in your game please send an email to request@tfngames.tk (We check your accounts for the Cosmetics)).

#### Examples for Requests
